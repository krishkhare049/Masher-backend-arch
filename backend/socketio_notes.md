# Requirements - 
user connects with the server and log its id etc
first whenever user sends a message or any request, i have to first store in database and then from inside that query i have to send event to that client or any other client.
i have to do it for every request and data, just a data update if required like someone liked, commented, message in chat if user is connected at that time. And a web socket connection as a background service to establish (if network available) if app is closed
