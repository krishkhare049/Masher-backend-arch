1. Codebase - Modular structure because it is easily maintainable and scalable
2. Database configuration - setup, indexing, sharding, backups, document limit
3. Nginx - to server images and static content
4. system drive raid 1 (mirroring)
5. database - raid 10
6. redis adapter for scalability
7. socket io sticky sessions



use ioredis and redis cluster, docker etc

then mqtt if required like whatsapp but slack also uses web sockets


in-app storage like whatsapp which will make application fast and also reduce load on servers
store files/photos/videos in separate db and whenever user sends to someone just add its id in his/her document

# Store only 15 searches max


The application database will only store user's data such name, username, password etc included in userModel.
But it will not store conversations and messages permanently, they will be deleted as soon as all users stores it in their own mobile storage.
So, we will not store any data on our servers, instead we delete them instantly after delivering them and also if the recipient is offline, we will delete those messages from our servers after 1 month.

By this, our storage will always be unfilled, we just need to store data for some time and then delete it

Keep conversations but delete messageIds in conversations and messages after each user stores it


Using sqlite instead of react/realm because it supports expo.

# Fetching conversation messages-
First i was using method to find conversation messages in which i using
async function getConversationAllMessages(req, res) {
    const skip = parseInt(req.params.skip) || 0;
    const limit = 40;

    const userId = new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user_id)
    // console.log(userId)

    const conversationId = req.params.conversationId;

    // console.log(conversationId)

    // Use aggregation to reverse the messageIds array and apply skip/limit
    const conversationMessages = await Conversation.aggregate([
        { $match: { _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(conversationId) } }, // Match the specific conversation
        { $project: { messageIds: { $reverseArray: "$messageIds" } } }, // Reverse the messageIds array
        { $unwind: "$messageIds" }, // Unwind to work with individual messages
        { $skip: skip }, // Skip the specified number of messages
        { $limit: limit }, // Limit the results to the specified number
        {
            $lookup: { // Populate messageIds with actual message data
                from: 'messages', // The messages collection name
                localField: 'messageIds',
                foreignField: '_id',
                as: 'message'
            }
        },
        { $unwind: "$message" }, // Unwind to flatten the results
        {
            $addFields: {
                isSender: { $eq: ["$message.sender", userId] } // Add a boolean field to check if the user is the sender
            }
        },
        // Optionally, you can add a $project stage here to format the output
        // {
        //     $project: {
        //         _id: "$message._id",
        //         sender: "$message.sender",
        //         content: "$message.content", // Replace with your actual message content field
        //         isSender: 1 // Include the isSender field
        //     }
        // }
    ]);

    but i can directly find message from conversationId field in their schema
    Performance Breakdown
Query Type	Approx. Time Complexity	Expected Performance
Direct Query (Message.find)	O(log N) to O(N) (Index Scan or Collection Scan)	Fast (Uses direct index lookups)
Aggregation with $lookup	O(N) + O(M) (Join + Filtering)	Slower (Joins require more computation)
Estimated Performance Impact
If you have ~10,000 messages per conversation
Direct Query: 5-50ms (Indexed)
Aggregation: 100-500ms (Join Overhead)
If you have ~100,000+ messages per conversation
Direct Query: 50-200ms
Aggregation: 500ms - 2s+ (Significant impact)
Why is Aggregation Slower?
$lookup performs a join-like operation, which scans the messageIds array and then fetches each message.
$unwind creates multiple documents per conversation, increasing processing time.
$match on deliveredTo.user after lookup increases filtering overhead.
Final Verdict?
🚀 Direct Query (Message.find) is at least 2-10x faster for large conversations because:

It directly queries the messages collection using an indexed conversationId.
It avoids costly $lookup operations.
It uses simple filtering ($ne: userId), making it lightweight.
If performance is a concern (which it should be for chat apps), go with the direct query.






You said:
suppose if message collection has 1 billion documents then
ChatGPT said:
If your Message collection has 1 billion documents, optimizing queries becomes critical. Here's what happens in both cases:

Performance Analysis at 1 Billion Documents
1️⃣ Direct Query (Message.find)
javascript
Copy
Edit
const conversationMessages = await Message.find({
    conversationId: conversationId,  // Uses an index
    "deliveredTo.user": { $ne: userId }   // Filter undelivered messages
})
.sort({ createdAt: -1 }) // Reverse order if needed
.skip(skip)
.limit(limit);
🔹 Performance
✅ Index Usage → O(log N) if conversationId is indexed.
✅ No Joins → Only searches in 1 collection (Message).
✅ Efficient Pagination → Uses skip() and limit().
❌ Potential Bottleneck if deliveredTo is large (i.e., many users in a group chat).

👉 Estimated Query Time: 10ms - 100ms (with proper indexing).

2️⃣ Aggregation with $lookup
javascript
Copy
Edit
const conversationMessages = await Conversation.aggregate([
    { $match: { _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(conversationId) } },
    { $project: { messageIds: { $reverseArray: "$messageIds" } } },
    { $unwind: "$messageIds" },
    { $skip: skip },
    { $limit: limit },
    {
        $lookup: {
            from: 'messages',
            localField: 'messageIds',
            foreignField: '_id',
            as: 'message'
        }
    },
    { $unwind: "$message" },
    { $match: { "message.deliveredTo.user": { $ne: userId } } },
]);
🔹 Performance
❌ Does NOT scale well → $lookup needs to scan billions of messages.
❌ Indexing on messageIds doesn’t help much → Still requires a full scan if message order changes.
❌ Memory & CPU-intensive → $unwind expands documents, increasing RAM usage.

👉 Estimated Query Time: 500ms - 5s+ (Very slow at scale).

🚀 Conclusion: Which is Better?
Approach	Speed (1B Docs)	Index Usage	Memory Usage	Scalability
Direct Query (Message.find)	10-100ms ⚡	✅ Efficient	✅ Low	✅ High
Aggregation ($lookup)	500ms - 5s+ 🐢	❌ Inefficient	❌ High	❌ Poor
Final Verdict
🚀 Use Message.find for performance & scalability.

Works efficiently with 1B+ messages if indexed properly.
$lookup will kill performance at this scale.
⚡ How to Optimize Further?
If you are handling billions of messages:

Indexes are a MUST

Compound Index: { conversationId: 1, createdAt: -1 }
Partial Index: { "deliveredTo.user": 1 } (for filtering undelivered messages)
Sharding in MongoDB (for horizontal scaling)

Shard key: conversationId
Distributes chat data across multiple servers.
Use Redis for Hot Messages

Cache recent messages in Redis to reduce database load.
Limit deliveredTo Array Growth

If a message has thousands of recipients, keep deliveredTo separately to avoid bloated documents.





















1.  Make indexing for group chats-
should i create index for deliveredTo too
ChatGPT said:
Yes, indexing deliveredTo can improve query performance, but only if used correctly. Here's how you should approach it:

Should You Index deliveredTo?
✅ YES, if:

You frequently query messages by "deliveredTo.user" (e.g., filtering undelivered messages).
Your chats have large groups with many recipients.
You have high read operations.
❌ NO, if:

Your chats are mostly one-to-one (since deliveredTo remains small).
deliveredTo has very few users per message (low impact on queries).
Writes are more frequent than reads (indexing adds overhead).
Best Indexing Strategy for deliveredTo
1️⃣ Partial Index on deliveredTo.user
If you only query undelivered messages, use a partial index to index only messages that haven't been delivered to a user:

javascript
Copy
Edit
db.messages.createIndex(
  { "deliveredTo.user": 1 },
  { partialFilterExpression: { "deliveredTo.user": { $exists: true } } }
);
✅ Why?
Faster undelivered message queries: { "deliveredTo.user": { $ne: userId } }
Reduces index size by ignoring messages with an empty deliveredTo.
2️⃣ Compound Index for Better Filtering
If you always query messages within a conversation, create a compound index:

javascript
Copy
Edit
db.messages.createIndex({ conversationId: 1, "deliveredTo.user": 1 });
✅ Why?
Queries like this will be blazing fast:
javascript
Copy
Edit
Message.find({
  conversationId: conversationId,
  "deliveredTo.user": { $ne: userId }
})
Helps MongoDB avoid a full scan of billions of messages.
🚀 Final Verdict
1:1 Chats? → No need for indexing deliveredTo.
Group Chats (Large deliveredTo Array)? → Use partial index.
Filtering undelivered messages inside a conversation? → Use compound index.
